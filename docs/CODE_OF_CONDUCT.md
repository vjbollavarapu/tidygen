# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [conduct@tidygen.com](mailto:conduct@tidygen.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at [conduct@tidygen.com](mailto:conduct@tidygen.com).

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information for follow-up
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- When and where the incident occurred
- Your account of what occurred
- Any additional context that may be helpful
- If you believe this incident is ongoing
- Any other information you believe we should have

## What Happens After You File a Report

You will receive an email from the project maintainers acknowledging receipt within 48 hours, and we will aim to provide a more detailed response within 7 days.

The project maintainers will then review the incident and determine:

1. What happened
2. Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
3. Who the bad actor was
4. Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the project maintainers' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the project maintainers have a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred)
- A private reprimand from the project maintainers to the individual(s) involved
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC)
- A public reprimand
- An imposed vacation from the project maintainers or project maintainers for a set period of time
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all project spaces (mailing lists, IRC, etc.)
- A request for a public or private apology

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

## Appeals

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the project maintainers, contact the project maintainers at [conduct@tidygen.com](mailto:conduct@tidygen.com) with your appeal and the project maintainers will review the case.
