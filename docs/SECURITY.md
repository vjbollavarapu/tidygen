## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@tidygen.com](mailto:security@tidygen.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Confirm receipt** of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Provide regular updates** on our progress
3. **Credit you** in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Response Process

1. **Initial Response**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop a fix for the vulnerability
4. **Testing**: We'll thoroughly test the fix
5. **Release**: We'll release the fix in a security update
6. **Disclosure**: We'll publish a security advisory

### Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge reports within 48 hours
- Provide initial assessment within 7 days
- Release a fix within 30 days (for critical vulnerabilities)
- Publish security advisory within 90 days
