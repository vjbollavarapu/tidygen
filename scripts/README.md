## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Script Security
- All scripts are executable only by authorized users
- Sensitive data is handled through environment variables
- Scripts include proper error handling and logging
- Input validation is performed where necessary

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required environment variables
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_NAME=tidygen_erp
export DB_USER=tidygen_user
export DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## 📊 Logging and Monitoring

### Log Files
- **Setup Logs**: `/var/log/tidygen/setup.log`
- **Deployment Logs**: `/var/log/tidygen/deployment.log`
- **Maintenance Logs**: `/var/log/tidygen/maintenance.log`

### Monitoring Integration
- Scripts integrate with monitoring systems
- Health checks report to monitoring dashboards
- Alerts are sent for critical failures

## 🔄 Automation

### Cron Jobs
```bash
# Daily database backup
0 2 * * * /path/to/scripts/maintenance/backup-db.sh

# Weekly dependency updates
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/scripts/maintenance/update-deps.sh

# Hourly health checks
0 * * * * /path/to/scripts/monitoring/check-health.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration
- Scripts are integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing and deployment
- Quality gates and approval processes

## 📚 Documentation

### Script Documentation
Each script includes:
- **Purpose**: What the script does
- **Usage**: How to run the script
- **Parameters**: Command-line arguments
- **Dependencies**: Required tools and services
- **Examples**: Usage examples

### Error Handling
- Proper exit codes for success/failure
- Detailed error messages
- Logging of all operations
- Rollback procedures for failed operations

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Run setup scripts first
3. **Environment Variables**: Check required environment variables
4. **Network Issues**: Verify connectivity to required services

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run scripts in debug mode
bash -x ./scripts/setup/setup-dev.sh

# Enable verbose logging
export VERBOSE=1
./scripts/deployment/deploy-prod.sh
```
