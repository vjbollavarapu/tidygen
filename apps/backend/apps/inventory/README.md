## Business Logic

### Stock Management
- **Automatic Stock Updates**: Stock levels are automatically updated when movements are created
- **Stock Alerts**: Low stock and out-of-stock alerts are generated automatically
- **Stock Forecasting**: Predicts stockout dates based on historical movement patterns
- **Movement Validation**: Prevents negative stock levels and validates movement types

### Purchase Order Management
- **Automatic Numbering**: Purchase orders receive sequential order numbers
- **Total Calculation**: Order totals are automatically calculated and updated
- **Status Management**: Order status changes are tracked and validated
- **Item Management**: Items can be added, modified, and removed with automatic total updates

### Multi-tenancy
- **Organization Isolation**: All data is automatically filtered by user's organization
- **Permission Control**: Access is controlled through organization membership
- **Data Segregation**: Complete separation of data between organizations

## Signals

The module uses Django signals to maintain data consistency:

- **Stock Movement Signals**: Automatically update product stock levels
- **Purchase Order Signals**: Automatically recalculate order totals
- **Product Signals**: Create initial stock movements for new products

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Product
```python
from apps.inventory.models import Product, ProductCategory

# Create category
category = ProductCategory.objects.create(
    name='Electronics',
    organization=user.organization
)

# Create product
product = Product.objects.create(
    name='Smartphone',
    sku='PHONE-001',
    category=category,
    cost_price=200.00,
    selling_price=299.99,
    current_stock=50,
    min_stock_level=10,
    max_stock_level=100,
    organization=user.organization
)
```

### Adjusting Stock
```python
from apps.inventory.models import StockMovement

# Add stock
movement = StockMovement.objects.create(
    product=product,
    movement_type='in',
    quantity=25,
    reference_number='PO-001',
    notes='Received from supplier'
)

# Stock is automatically updated
product.refresh_from_db()
print(product.current_stock)  # 75
```

### Creating Purchase Order
```python
from apps.inventory.models import PurchaseOrder, PurchaseOrderItem

# Create purchase order
po = PurchaseOrder.objects.create(
    supplier=supplier,
    order_date=date.today(),
    expected_delivery=date.today() + timedelta(days=7),
    organization=user.organization
)

# Add items
item = PurchaseOrderItem.objects.create(
    purchase_order=po,
    product=product,
    quantity=10,
    unit_price=200.00
)

# Total is automatically calculated
po.refresh_from_db()
print(po.total_amount)  # 2000.00
```

## Configuration

### Settings
The module integrates with the core Django settings and requires:

- `django_filters` for advanced filtering
- `django_rest_framework` for API functionality
- Proper database configuration for decimal fields
- File storage configuration for product images

### Permissions
- **IsAuthenticated**: Users must be authenticated
- **IsOrganizationMember**: Users must belong to the organization

### Filters
Advanced filtering is available for all models:

- **Text Search**: Search by name, description, SKU, etc.
- **Range Filters**: Filter by price, stock levels, dates
- **Status Filters**: Filter by active status, stock status, order status
- **Relationship Filters**: Filter by category, supplier, organization

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexes**: Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient queries with select_related and prefetch_related
- **Caching**: Consider caching for dashboard summaries and stock alerts
- **Pagination**: API endpoints support pagination for large datasets

## Security Features

- **Organization Isolation**: Complete data separation between organizations
