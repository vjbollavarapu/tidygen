# TidyGen ERP: Web3-Enabled Open Source ERP

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** TidyGen ERP  
**Project Repository:** [https://github.com/vcsmy/tidygen-erp](https://github.com/vcsmy/tidygen-erp)  
**Grant Category:** Application Development (Infrastructure + Tooling)  
**Team Name:** TidyGen Labs  
**Payment Address:** (Your Polkadot or Kusama address here)  

### Overview

TidyGen ERP is a modular, open-source ERP system designed to serve both enterprises and communities.  
We propose two versions:  
- **Community Edition (Single-Tenant):** Open-source, self-hostable ERP solution.  
- **Commercial Edition (Multi-Tenant):** Enterprise-grade SaaS with dealer, partner, and reseller support.  

This grant focuses on extending TidyGen ERP with **Web3-native capabilities**, making it a core open-source ERP for decentralized ecosystems.  

### Problem Statement

Most ERP systems are:  
- **Centralized** – creating single points of failure.  
- **Closed ecosystems** – difficult to integrate with decentralized identity, payments, or storage.  
- **Expensive** – prohibitive for SMEs, startups, and DAOs.  

TidyGen ERP aims to fill this gap with a **Web3-native ERP system**, lowering entry barriers for organizations seeking open, decentralized, and verifiable business management tools.
