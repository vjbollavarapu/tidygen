# tidygen

## Project Overview

**TidyGen** is a Web3 + AI-powered developer tool designed to accelerate and simplify Substrate-based smart contract development. It uniquely combines AI-driven code generation with decentralized identity (DID) login, offering a secure, user-centric platform that aligns with Web3 principles of decentralization and user sovereignty.

The tool generates modular, clean smart contract code tailored for deployment on Substrate-based blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem.
